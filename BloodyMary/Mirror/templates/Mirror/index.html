        <h1>BLOODY MARY</h1>
        <u style="color:black font">Description</u>
        <br>
        &emsp;Bloody Mary is now believed to be a malevolent Spirit/Ghost. To summon Bloody Mary, you need to chant her name three times at midnight in front of a mirror, in a dimly light room often with a candle. The potential upside to this is she may be able to tell you your future. However, this is rarely the case. Most commonly, Bloody Mary will now try to kill you. She can even appear in any mirror at any time after the process. Resist breaking the mirror because this will set her free (Peters). 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;The origins of the ghost are highly debated, there are three people who could possibly have been the inspiration 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;Firstly, there's Mary Worth. One theory suggests that Mary had an unwanted pregnancy yet grew attached to her child. Unfortunately, the child died leading to Mary becoming depressed. She took her own life in front of a mirror. Additionally, another popular theory is that Mary was a kind witch that would use her knowledge to help heal the townsfolk where she lived. However, after she failed to help some children, the townspeople accused her of killing them. She was burned in front of a mirror, forcing her to witness her own death (Urban Legends Wiki). 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;Secondly, Queen Mary I of England, born in 1516 to Henry VIII. She was not originally supposed to become Queen. However, she led a charge into London in 1553 and took the throne for herself. She soon developed the title of Bloody Mary through her inhumane actions. She desired a return to the Catholic faith and enacted laws to burn heretics at the stake. It is believed she wanted this to be a deterrent that was rarely used. Unsurprisingly, people fought hard against this leading to 300 deaths between 1555 and 1558. She died unable to bear a child to take the throne. The appearance of today's Bloody Mary is inspired from her era. The ghost is often shown wearing a renaissance era nightgown. She also has long black hair and a half rotten female body (Howard). 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;Thirdly, a much lesser-known potential inspiration is Elizabeth Bathory. She was a Hungarian noblewoman who, unlike Queen Elizabeth I, was known to be a murderer for her own enjoyment. From 1590 to 1610, many rumors spread. She had been torturing young women and killing them in gruesome manner. She is suspected to have killed 80 people. Witnesses claim she had killed closer to 650 people and that she kept records of all the murders. Regardless, even she still had supporters who claimed the charges were false and made up by the king who owed her debts (Howard).

        <u style="color:black font">Location and Time Period</u>
        <br>
        &emsp;The history behind Bloody Mary is very murky. 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;Starting off, Bloody Mary is probably a variation of the Japanese folktale, Hanako-san. This urban myth is about a young girl who died during World War 2 and haunts school bathrooms. To summon her, you need to knock three times on a bathroom stall saying, "Hanako-san, are you there". This is closely related to how you must say Bloody Mary three times and the fact that the Bloody Mary ritual often happened in bathrooms with mirrors. This story was first mentioned around the 1950s, so it is likely the modern version of Bloody Mary developed around the same time (Meyer). 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;Another possible source could be a ritual that women used to find their future lovers in the 19th century. Woman were told to wait until night and dim all the lights in their house. Then, walk backwards up the stairs with a candle in hand. When gazing into a mirror, they would see their future husband or a skull. This was popular in both Europe and North America. 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;It was likely a combination of the two previous urban myths along with many others leading to the modern tale of Bloody Mary (Peters). 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;The Folklorist Janet Langlois’s essay, “Mary Whales, I Believe in You” showed several renditions of the Bloody Mary myth from throughout the early 70s in the United States. 
        <br><br>
         
        
        <u style="color:black font">Popular Culture</u>
        <br>
        &emsp;Today, the Bloody Mary ritual is still alive and very popular. I personally remember hearing about it when I was a kid. Most people have heard the legend shared orally. However, it’s still made many appearances in popular culture in movies, games, etc. 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;-Bloody Mary appears in: 
        <br>
        &emsp;-The movie “Urban Legends: Bloody Mary” made in 2005 
        <br>
        &emsp;-The movie “Truth or Dare” made in 2018 
        <br>
        &emsp;-The video game series “Silent Hill”  
        <br>
        &emsp;-The movie “Annabelle Comes Home” made in 2019 
        <br><br>
         
        
        <u style="color:black font">Communication</u>
        <br>
        &emsp;The Bloody Mary legend is very commonly shared in any space involving scary stories. Examples include sleepovers, campfires, and just any conversation to kill time in general. Because of this, the story is mainly shared orally.  
        <br><br>
        &emsp;The movies, books and physical renditions do not do its popularity justice. Movies, books and more are not quite popular, but most people I’ve spoken to have heard the myth before. 
        <br><br>
        
        <u style="color:black font">Function</u>
        <br>
        &emsp;The main function of the Bloody Mary myth is quite simple, to scare and entertain. This is why it has remained so popular overtime. 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;However, some deeper meaning to the myth is likely related to young women. The Witch Mary Worth was rumored to have killed young children leading to this being a warning story directed at children. Additionally, Mary I, Queen of England was well known for not being able to give birth to an heir to her throne. Again, linking this myth to children. Therefore, it seems to be a warning to children against dabbling in the supernatural because of the danger. 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;Moreover, a potential inspiration to this story would be the Japanese tale Hanako-san. Hanako-san serves as a warning to children to respect the privacy of others in the bathroom. This could transfer over to the Bloody Mary myth. Another lesson to let the supernatural spirits be undisturbed. 
        <br><br>
        &emsp;Also, there are many details in the crime scenes leading to a much different message. Notice, in most stories there is an emphasis on lots of blood. Further, this is a ritual performed by young women often in the bathroom. Therefore, a common theory is that this is a description of puberty (Dundes).  
        <br><br>
         
        
        <u style="color:black font">Suggested Resources</u>
        <br>
        Right now, the best resource for looking into this further would-be YouTube or other forms of social media. The reason the myth is so popular today is that it is a fascinating and scary story to hear. Watching haunted stories or videos about it does the story justice. Some good videos are:
